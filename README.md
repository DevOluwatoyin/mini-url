## Summary about the app

**[Mini-url]** is a Url shortner website. One of the main features of the app is the ChatBot that answers basic questions about the website.

* The major challenge I faced while building the application was configuring
   the chatbot's responses to different prompts.
 
 * One important lesson I learned while working on the project is to never give up early when
   trying to debug a seemingly tough bug.

## How to run the app
* Clone the repo and run npm install
* Run npm run dev.
